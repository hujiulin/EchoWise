## Philosophy

> Stop studying English. Start using English.

Most English-learning apps teach you English. EchoWise helps you **use** it.

We don't drill vocabulary, hand out exercises, or assign grades. We let you build real communication ability by having ordinary daily conversations with an AI companion who becomes increasingly familiar over time.

- **Communication before perfection** — Imperfect English that connects beats perfect grammar that stays silent
- **Relationship before knowledge** — A polite stranger on Day 1, an easy old friend by Day 180
- **Gentle nudges, never interruptions** — No lectures mid-sentence; one-glance hints when something's worth a tweak
- **Local-first** — All data lives on your machine, nothing leaves it

---

## Features

| | |
|---|---|
| 🗣️ **A companion that grows** | One companion you name, style (avatar / voice / persona) and shape. Day-count + a 5-tier relationship arc (stranger → old friend) that the AI's tone naturally follows. |
| 🎙️ **Voice-first conversation** | Speak via mic or type — both work. Voice-message-style bubbles: tap the waveform to play; transcript is one click away. |
| 💡 **Non-intrusive coaching** | The AI never lectures mid-reply. A 1–100 score chip in 5 colors (Try again / Getting there / Clear / Natural / Native-like) sits quietly on your bubble. |
| 📈 **Growth that actually means something** | Confidence trend (5-sentence rolling average, updates as you talk) · 5-band distribution · auto-picked "best so far" + "worth revisiting". |
| 🎨 **Full appearance customization** | Theme (system / light / dark), 4 fonts, 4 sizes, 6 preset gradient backgrounds or upload your own. |
| 🔌 **Multi-provider** | OpenAI / Azure OpenAI with one click. Defaults: `gpt-5` + `gpt-4o-transcribe` + `gpt-4o-mini-tts` (voice instructions adapt to your companion's persona). |
| 🔄 **Auto-update** | Signed in-app updater. Background check at launch; one-click install when a new version is published. |
| 💾 **Fully local** | SQLite + filesystem. Every conversation, recording, and AI voice clip stays on your machine forever. |

## Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites

| Tool | Why | Install |
|---|---|---|
| **Node.js ≥ 18** | Frontend bundler | <https://nodejs.org> |
| **Rust (stable)** | Tauri backend | `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs \| sh` |
| **Platform SDK** | Native toolchain | macOS: `xcode-select --install`<br>Windows: VS Build Tools<br>Linux: `webkit2gtk` |

Verify:
```bash
node -v && rustc -V && cargo -V
```

### 2. Run (dev)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hujiulin/EchoWise.git
cd EchoWise
npm install
npm run dev
```

Vite starts, Rust compiles, the native desktop window pops open (~2–3 min the first time, incremental builds in seconds after).

> **macOS devs**: after the first launch, open a separate terminal and run `npm run sign:dev` to inject the microphone entitlement into the dev binary — otherwise macOS denies `getUserMedia`. See [scripts/tauri-dev.sh](scripts/tauri-dev.sh) for the full story.

### 3. Build a release

```bash
# One-time: generate platform icons
npx @tauri-apps/cli icon src-tauri/icons/icon.svg

npm run build
```

Installers land in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`:
- macOS → `.dmg` / `.app`
- Windows → `.msi` / `.exe`
- Linux → `.AppImage` / `.deb`

### 4. First-run configuration

Launch and open **Settings → AI provider**:

| Field | Default |
|---|---|
| Provider | OpenAI |
| Base URL | `https://api.openai.com/v1` |
| LLM model | `gpt-5` |
| ASR model | `gpt-4o-transcribe` |
| TTS model | `gpt-4o-mini-tts` |
| TTS voice | `nova` |

Paste your API key → **Test connection** → **Save**.

**Azure OpenAI** also works: flip the preset at the top, fill in endpoint + api-version + three deployment names.

## Where data lives

Everything stays on **your** machine — nothing is uploaded.

| Platform | Path |
|---|---|
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/com.echowise.app/` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\com.echowise.app\` |
| Linux | `~/.local/share/com.echowise.app/` |

```
com.echowise.app/
├── echowise.db        # SQLite — companion, conversations, turns, stats, prefs
├── audio/<convId>/    # Your recordings (webm) + AI TTS playback (mp3)
├── avatars/           # Uploaded companion avatars
└── backgrounds/       # Uploaded background images
```

Uninstalling the app **doesn't** auto-delete this folder. Remove it manually for a clean wipe.

## Auto-update setup (maintainers)

EchoWise ships with an in-app updater powered by `tauri-plugin-updater`. The desktop app polls a JSON manifest at app launch and from the Settings → About panel; when a signed bundle is newer than the installed version, the user can install it with one click.

Out of the box the update check is wired up but **signing is unconfigured** — the app will run fine without it, but auto-update will be disabled until you set it up. To enable:

### 1. Generate a signing keypair (one time)

```bash
npx @tauri-apps/cli signer generate -w ~/.tauri/echowise-updater.key
```

Two files are written:
- `~/.tauri/echowise-updater.key` — **private** key. Store it somewhere safe (password manager, secrets vault). Never commit it.
- `~/.tauri/echowise-updater.key.pub` — public key. Print and copy it.

### 2. Embed the public key in `tauri.conf.json`

```json
"plugins": {
  "updater": {
    "active": true,
    "pubkey": "<paste the content of echowise-updater.key.pub here>",
    "endpoints": [
      "https://github.com/hujiulin/EchoWise/releases/latest/download/latest.json"
    ]
  }
}
```

Commit this change.

### 3. Add GitHub repo secrets

In GitHub → repository → **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**, add:

| Secret | Value |
|---|---|
| `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` | Contents of `~/.tauri/echowise-updater.key` |
| `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD` | The password you set in step 1 (or empty if none) |

### 4. Ship a release

Push a `v*` tag as usual. The release workflow will:
- Build per-platform installers
- Sign each updater bundle with your private key
- Upload a `latest.json` manifest alongside the installers

Existing users will see the update inside the app on next launch (after a quiet background check) and in **Settings → About → Updates**.

### Endpoint format

The `latest.json` file follows the [Tauri v2 schema](https://v2.tauri.app/plugin/updater/):

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "notes": "What's new",
  "pub_date": "2026-06-07T10:00:00Z",
  "platforms": {
    "darwin-aarch64": {
      "signature": "<base64>",
      "url": "https://github.com/.../EchoWise_0.2.0_aarch64.app.tar.gz"
    },
    "darwin-x86_64":  { ... },
    "windows-x86_64": { ... }
  }
}
```

The release workflow generates this automatically when `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` is set.
